== deno jekyll

Deno seems to be a forward looking scripting engine:

* capabilities-based security
* built-in dependency management
* ok-ish typed scripting language
* with WASM, ability to get extra from the CPU and to have better re-usability

Crucially, it has the ability to `eval` code, which is neat for end-user defined plugins.

It'd be prudent to migrate Jekyll+Asciidoctor setup to Deno
