== deno jekyll

Deno seems to be a forward looking scripting engine:

* capabilities-based security
* built-in dependency management
* ok-ish typed scripting language
* with WASM, ability to get extra from the CPU and to have better re-usability

Crucially, it has the ability to `eval` code, which is neat for end-user defined plugins.

It'd be prudent to migrate Jekyll+Asciidoctor setup to Deno

== Asciidoc parser

Event-based Asciidoctor parser in Rust will solve one of the major problems of Asciidoctor -- the fact that it is tied to the ruby implementation.
This asciidoctor spec though, preferably in a way which doesn't require running arbitrary user code during parsing to deal with macros and includes.

== shell

Basically, https://matklad.github.io/2019/11/16/a-better-shell.html[a better shell].
Good opportunity to try out Smalltalk?
