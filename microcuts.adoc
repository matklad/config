= Microcuts

Minor annoyances I with Rust didn't have.

*Cargo directory layout.*
We should have done directory-per-crate.
Collocating `lib.rs` and `main.rs` causes confusion.
On a similar note, `tests` and `benches` should be _one_ crate by default, to save compile times

*Incomplete mod.rs transition.*
De-facto, both `foo/mod.rs` and `foo.rs` are used today.
It would probably be better if only one way was allowed.

*Nested imports.*
We now allow `use crate::{module::{item}}`, which we used not to.
As a result, projects are split by the import style they use.
Seems better if we sticked with simple one-level nesting only.

*Complex Visibility Rules*
`pub(crate)` is a lot to type, `pub(in ...)` doesn't pull its weight, imports creating item is confusing and not useful.
It'd be better to have just `pub` with the meaning of `pub(crate)` and `pub*` for exporting across crate boundary.
